## Background
This is toy simulation is made for a course I attended on Coaching and Leadership. In the pre-COVID days, a team of 4-6  participants were given a piece of paper and following instruction:
1. Fold the paper on marked lines to make a toy helicopter.
2. On this toy Helicopter you can change the folds to control following attribute:
    a. Wing Length (Long/Short)
    b. Body Length (Long/Short)
    c. Wing Width (Wide/Narrow)
    d. Fins ( With/Without Fins)
    e. Nose Weight (With/Without)
2. Throw  the paper from the height of 2 meters and record the total flight time.

From these set of experiments you are asked to monitor and record the total flight time.

During COVID, the course has to be conducted virtually and it was not possible to run these experiment. Hence, I thought to make this toy App to facilitate the experiment virtually.


## Install

1. Clone this repo to your machine.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Ozeidi/Recursive-Tree.git
```
2. To test the code, I highly recommend using VS Code. I use `Live Server` extension to serve the app locally.
